            <p>PhotoBackup works with two applications, a client and a server,
                dedicated to the backup of the pictures you take on your
                mobile device to your own server.</p>
            <p>You need four little steps:</p>

            <ol style="font-size:1.4em;">
                <li><a href="http://play.google.com">Install a mobile application</a> ;</li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/stephanepechard/photobackup-servers">
                    Install one of the server applications</a> ;
                </li>
                <li>Take pictures as usual and let the magic happens in background ;</li>
                <li>Keep your pictures safe on your server.</li>
